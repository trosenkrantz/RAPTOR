# RAPTOR
Rapid Assessment and Protocol-based Testing of Operational Responders (RAPTOR) is a tool for analysing and testing systems that interface through low-level networking protocols.

It exchanges data with systems, either as a standalone, interactive console application or scripted through command line arguments. It is useful for:

- Experimenting with unfamiliar systems by using RAPTOR to interact with them.

- Testing integrations by using RAPTOR to simulate systems we may not have access to.

- Testing distributed systems by using RAPTOR as a gateway to simulate middleware and network impairment we may not have access to.

## Capabilities
- UDP:
  - Unicast, multicast, and broadcast.
  - Send and receive.
- TCP:
  - Client and server.
  - With and without TLS.
- SNMP:
  - GET, SET, and TRAP operations.
  - Arbitrary data support trough Basic Encoding Rules (BER) encoding.
- Serial port.
- WebSocket:
  - Client.
  - server:
    - Multiple concurrent client connections.
  - With and without TLS (`wss://` and `ws://`).
- Gateway between protocols, forwarding traffic:
  - UDP multicast and serial port.
  - Simulate network impairment:
    - Latency, corruption, packet loss, and duplication.
- Sending capabilities:
  - Interactively send text and binary data.
  - Configure auto-replying (when receiving x, then send y).
    - Text and binary data.
    - Use regular expressions to match input, even for binary input.
    - Define states, running a state machine.
- Arbitrary OS support through Java, shell scripts, and .cmd (Windows) scripts.
- Can be used as CLI.
- Portable application, can be run from a USB stick.
- Logging to capture data exchange.

## Getting Started
1. Download a release and unzip it.
2. Either
   - Download Java Runtime Environment 21 (e.g. [Azul Zulu](https://www.azul.com/downloads/?version=java-21-lts&package=jre#zulu)) or newer, extracting it to a `java` dir:
     ```
     ├── java
     │   ├── bin
     │   ├── conf
     │   └── ...
     ├── libs
     ├── LICENCE
     ├── raptor
     └── ...
     ```
   - Or install Java 21 or newer on your machine.
3. Run either the `raptor` shell script or `raptor.cmd` script.

RAPTOR will then guide you how to use it.

## Encoding
RAPTOR supports arbitrary bytes, yet allows inputting printable ASCII characters as-is. To support this, we must input to RAPTOR either:
- Printable ASCII characters (except `"` and `\`) as-is, e.g., `abc`.
- The escape sequences `\n`, `\r`, `\t`, `\"`, and `\\`. 
- Escaped hex strings `\\x00` through `\\xff` (any casing).
- A mix of the above, e.g., `\\x00Hello\n` represents the 7 bytes with hex values `00`, `48`, `65`, `6c`, `6c`, `6f`, and `0a`.

RAPTOR outputs and logs with this encoding as well, allowing for easy copy-paste. Additionally, RAPTOR can convert between files and this encoding.

## CLI

Starting RAPTOR without arguments will prompt us to configure it. After configuration, it will output and log the configuration as CLI arguments, escaped and quoted as needed, e.g.:
```
Using arguments:
--service=udp --mode=unicast --role=send --destination-address=localhost --destination-port=50000 "--payload=Hello, World\!"
```

We can now run RAPTOR with the arguments directly without user interaction.

## Auto-Reply

For two-way communication (inputs and outputs), we can configure RAPTOR to auto-reply using a JSON file. Example:
```json5
{
    "startState": "login",
    "states": {
        "login": [
            {
                "input": "login!", // When RAPTOR receives this
                "output": "ok!", // It output this
                "nextState": "active" // And move to this state
            }
        ],
        "active": [
            {
                "input": "set: \\d+!", // Use regexes
                "output": "\\x00\\xff" // Denote arbitrary bytes with \\xhh encoding
                // Absent nextState means stay
            },
            {
                "input": "\\x00(\\x01)*!", // Include arbitrary bytes in regexes
                "output": "\\x00ok\n" // Mix arbitrary bytes, printable characters, and control characters
            }
        ]
    }
}
```
RAPTOR checks for matching inputs in the order of appearance. It ignores simple line and block comments but does not use JSON5.

### TCP and Serial Port
For TCP and serial port auto-replies, RAPTOR passes input to the state machine byte by byte. Thus, RAPTOR behaves the same regardless of how data is buffered.

See [replies.json](src/main/distributions/replies.json) for an example.

### SNMP
For SNMP auto-replies, `input` is the OID in dot notation and `output` is the BER encoding of the response variable.

If RAPTOR finds no output to an SNMP auto-reply, it responds with Null.

See [snmp-replies.json](src/main/distributions/snmp-replies.json) for an example.

### WebSocket
For WebSocket auto-replies, `input` is the whole payload data received, either for a text or binary frame.

See [replies.json](src/main/distributions/replies.json) for an example.

## TLS
RAPTOR is purposed for testing and analysis, not for operational usage. When using TLS, it does not verify certificates.

## ANSI
RAPTOR uses ANSI escape codes to colour outputs. We can disable it with a `--no-ansi` argument in case our console does not support it.
